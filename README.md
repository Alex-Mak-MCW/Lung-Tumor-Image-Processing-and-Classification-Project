# Lung Tumor Image Processing and Classification Project

This project leverages Python's deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow and Keras, to classify lung tumor types from medical images. Pre-trained neural network models were trained, validated, and fine-tuned to achieve over 93% classification accuracy. The findings were visualized using matplotlib and seaborn, and detailed in a comprehensive research report.
